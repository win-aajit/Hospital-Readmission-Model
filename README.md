# Hospital-Readmission-Model

Project worked on by Ashwin Ajit, Anupam Pradeep, Rebecca Han, Mahi Sheth

Project Overview:
Hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge represent a significant challenge for 
healthcare systems, contributing to increased costs, hospital penalties, and poorer patient 
outcomes. This report investigates predictors of hospital readmission among diabetic patients 
using ten years of clinical data from U.S. hospitals. Through extensive exploratory data analysis, 
feature engineering, and the application of both linear and nonlinear predictive models, we assess 
the extent to which patient demographics and healthcare utilization intensity explain readmission 
risk. Across all models, predictive performance is modest (AUC ≈ 0.61–0.64), suggesting that 
there are structural limits to predictability from administrative clinical data alone. Our findings 
highlight utilization intensity as the dominant signal, motivating future work that incorporates 
social, behavioral, and longitudinal patient data.
